    "### Custom Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: Tools you build yourself for specific needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**: Complete control over functionality — you build exactly what your agent needs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Function Tools**\n",
    "- **What**: Python functions converted to agent tools\n",
    "- **Examples**: `get_fee_for_payment_method`, `get_exchange_rate`\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Turn any Python function into an agent tool instantly\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Long Running Function Tools**\n",
    "- **What**: Functions for operations that take significant time\n",
    "- **Examples**: Human-in-the-loop approvals, file processing\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Agents can start tasks and continue with other work while waiting\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Agent Tools**\n",
    "- **What**: Other agents used as tools\n",
    "- **Examples**: `AgentTool(agent=calculation_agent)`\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Build specialist agents and reuse them across different systems\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **MCP Tools**\n",
    "- **What**: Tools from Model Context Protocol servers\n",
    "- **Examples**: Filesystem access, Google Maps, databases\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Connect to any MCP-compatible service without custom integration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **OpenAPI Tools**\n",
    "- **What**: Tools automatically generated from API specifications\n",
    "- **Examples**: REST API endpoints become callable tools\n",
    "- **Advantage**: No manual coding — just provide an API spec and get working tools\n",
